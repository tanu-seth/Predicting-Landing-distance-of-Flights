## Predicting-Landing-distance-of-Flights

#### Background
There is a high risk of landing overrun if the aircraftâ€™s landing distance exceeds the available
distance. The landing distance required is affected by many factors. We use the simulated data
provided by Professor Dr. Liu to study the factors involved and how they would impact the
landing distance of a commercial flight.

#### Motivation
To reduce landing overrun

#### Goal
To study what factors and how they would impact the landing distance of a commercial flight

#### Steps Followed
1) Understanding and importing the data
2) Merging the data
3) Removing the duplicates and abnormal values
4) Handling missing values
5) Correlation analysis with respect to the target feature
6) Identifying the significant parameters
7) Fitting a linear regression model to the get the relationship between independent
variables and target feature
8) Model Diagonistic and Re fitting
